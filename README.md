Kia Ora, I'm Lou, a Full Stack Developer from the windy city of Wellington, NZ! I'm brand new to the coding world which makes me super excited to be here and just wanting to get my hands on everything.

Recently, I completed a life changing bootcamp for software development and it has really cemented a need to code.
Some of the coding I learnt included:  

Javascript
<br>
Typescript
<br>
React
<br>
Redux and redux thunk
<br>
HTML, CSS and SASS
<br>
Rest APIS
<br>
Knex
<br>
Express
<br>
SQL Lite

My main goal right now is just learn from great people, and keep on coding.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm currently dabbling in...

I'm so new to coding that I'm a 'coding magpie' so everything is shiny and exciting! There are so so many things I find I am drawn to. 
Right now I about about to look into three.js, next.js and because in my final project at Devacademy I implemented Material UI -  i'm keen to look at another SASS design framework.

[Get out of jail!] 
Super cute starter react game! Completed with location based movement and character changes. It gets odd and the title actually has no reflection on the game itself - but was fun to make!

[League management] 
This website was intended for a manager of a league, where they could go in and manage a team of players. 
The stretch challenge on this was to get to trading players between teams - but we didn't quite get there.
